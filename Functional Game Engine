FunGEn (Functional Game Engine) is a BSD-licensed, cross-platform, 
OpenGL/GLUT-based, non-FRP game engine/framework written in Haskell. 
Created by Andre Furtado in 2002, it's the oldest Haskell game engine, 
and with very few dependencies and two example games, it's one of 
the easiest ways to get started with Haskell game development. It provides:

Initialization, updating, removing, rendering and grouping routines for game objects
Definition of a game background (or map), including texture-based maps and tile maps
Reading and intepretation of the player's keyboard and mouse input Collision detection
Time-based functions and pre-defined game actions Loading and displaying of 24-bit 
bitmap files Some debugging and game performance evaluation facilities
Simon Michael provides basic maintenance for this package.
