Introduction to Haskell

For many years, from 2000 to 2012, I taught a course in the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham on the pure, 
functional, programming language Haskell. This comprised ten fifty-minute lectures together with supervised lab sessions. 
Some of the material I covered in this course was made available to the students on the internet, but in a very rudimentary
form. More recently, I have expanded and updated this material and have made it more generally available.

unit	exercises no.	name	questions	answers
1	Getting started	questions	answers
2	Lists	questions	answers
3	Floating-point numbers	questions	answers
4	ZF-expressions	questions	answers
5	Higher-order functions	questions	answers
6	The fold functions	questions	answers
7	Tuples	questions	answers
8	Stream-based interaction	questions	
9	Datatypes	questions	
Note that exercises are provided for each of the units and that answers are available
for the first seven sets of exercises. Unfortunately, some of the answers are not correct.
I hope to correct those that are wrong in due course.
