Tokyo Haskell Meetup is a group that meets mostly every month in Tokyo. 
English is the dominant language and we enjoy casual and lively discussions of 
Haskell and Functional Languages, (and others including Philosophy, Politics, Business, etc.), 
while helping each other learn Haskell. 

Our members proficiency in Haskell is very diverse â€“ from the beginners (such as myself) to the experts.
