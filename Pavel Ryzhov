Book Description
Haskell is one of the three most influential functional programming languages available today 
along with Lisp and Standard ML. When used for financial analysis, you can achieve a much-improved 
level of prediction and clear problem descriptions.

Haskell Financial Data Modeling and Predictive Analytics is a hands-on guide that employs a mix 
of theory and practice. Starting with the basics of Haskell, this book walks you through the 
mathematics involved and how this is implemented in Haskell.

The book starts with an introduction to the Haskell platform and the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC). 
You will then learn about the basics of high frequency financial data mathematics as well as how to 
implement these mathematical algorithms in Haskell.

You will also learn about the most popular Haskell libraries and frameworks like Attoparsec, 
QuickCheck, and HMatrix. You will also become familiar with database access using Yesodâ€™s Persistence 
library, allowing you to keep your data organized. The book then moves on to discuss the mathematics 
of counting processes and autoregressive conditional duration models, which are quite common modeling
tools for high frequency tick data. At the end of the book, you will also learn about the volatility 
prediction technique.

With Haskell Financial Data Modeling and Predictive Analytics, you will learn everything you need 
to know about financial data modeling and predictive analytics using functional programming in Haskell.
